        <p className="project-summary">
        I developed an app called Disney Movie Finder that fetches data from an API containing details about various movies. The app displays essential information such as the title, rating, and duration of each movie in an organized list format. Users can easily search for movies and sort them based on their ratings, helping them quickly find the movies they're interested in
