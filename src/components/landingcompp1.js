                <p>I participated in the finals of Brainhack, CODE_EXP competition, which took place at Marina Bay Sands on June 12th and 13th, 2024.  Brainhack 2024 has seen 4000 participants from 109 schools, which consists of many university students.</p>
                <p>During the finals, Binary Blossoms developed a functional mobile app, Be-Leaf. It consists of an AI recognition to determine recyclables and non-recyclable objects. Binary Blossoms also pitched to a large crowd at MBS, including university students.</p>
                <p>It was an exciting and enriching event that pushed my limits and broadened my knowledge and skills. It is also marked as a significant accomplishment for my team, especially since it was our first time participating in any competition. Binary Blossoms is very proud of what we have achieved in this competition.</p>
