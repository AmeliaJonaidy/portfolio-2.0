                <p>Singapore Youth for Christ is an organization with a range of ministries, and I serve as a student leader in the polytechnic ministry. I became a member when I joined the PFP program in 2022 and took on the role of student leader at the beginning of my first year in 2023.</p>
                <p>As a member, I've taken part in a variety of activities and even assisted with organizing a few. In September 2024, I attended the FellowSheep Partea as a participant. In addition, I was active in organizing the "Rest and Play Holiday PEP" for Christian Republic Polytechnic students, which provided an opportunity for fellowship over the holidays. During school, I attended weekly gatherings to discuss specific themes or carry out a bible study.</p>
